# WebXR
WebXR Sample deploy using a Mozilla UnityWebXRExporter and OpenVR using the Sunny Desert Sample. Changes to shader for Quest deploy and removing objects and some scene artifacts including addding some additional inputs of hands closing added. We did not use the Unity plugin from Asset Store but got the Unity exporter directly from github source.The project was done using Unity 2019.x version. Unity 2020 is not yet supported based on Mozilla Hub. if you try to load the default scene using some of the standard steps mentioned you may end with a "pink like scene" initially.
